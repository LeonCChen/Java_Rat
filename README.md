# JavaRAT

# Description
What?

`Java Rat` is a remote administration tool in java to allow someone to pull information from a larege group of computers relatively quickly.

Why?

This program serves as a way for us to increase our fundamental understanding of network programming, and creates a great tool that is relelvant in some real world settings

How?

This is designed as a Remote Administration Tool (RAT) that calls back to a Command and Control Server (CNC Server). The CNC server will allow a user to send commands/requests to individual clients and get a reply based on the request; whether it be for a file, OS Version, or other information. The RAT will perform actions on the machine it is running on and send data back to the CNC server when finished.
