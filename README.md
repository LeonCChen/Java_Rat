# JavaRAT

## Description
### What?

`Java Rat` is a remote administration tool in java to allow someone to pull information from a larege group of computers relatively quickly.

### Why?

This program serves as a way for us to increase our fundamental understanding of network programming, and creates a great tool that is relelvant in some real world settings

### How?

This is designed as a Remote Administration Tool (RAT) that calls back to a Command and Control Server (CNC Server). The CNC server will allow a user to send commands/requests to individual clients and get a reply based on the request; whether it be for a file, OS Version, or other information. The RAT will perform actions on the machine it is running on and send data back to the CNC server when finished.

## Deliverables

1. CNC Server
2. Client / RAT
3. Documentation

# Comments
1. On the plan, need to speed up the process in design and try to start implementing ASAP. It is better to finish designing this week and start implementing next week.
2. Expand the deriverables as discussed offline. It is good to see you have a features list for MVP and you can just bring the list into this page.
3. Think about what you are going to demo in the final presentation and compile the MVP features accordingly. If you have more time, you can always add more features at the end and it will not affect the overall progress of the project, but make sure the core should work first
