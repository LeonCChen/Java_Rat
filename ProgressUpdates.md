# Progress Updates (Oct 22 - Dec 3)

## Week 0 (Oct 22 - Oct 29)

### What did your team do last week?
* Created a list of features to add
* Started finding different libraries that enable these features to be used.

### What will you do this week?
* Pick features that seem the most viable for a MVP
* Start making user-stories based on these features
* Start making rough UML diagram based on selected features

### Any blocking issues/challenges need to be addressed?
* Some features seem too difficult to implement in a reasonable time.
    * Solution: Chose core features for MVP
* Only viable for RAT to work on one platform (Windows) for the time we have
    * Solution: Not using a real exploit for now, just a bootstrapping client that creates
                a backdoor for purposes of presentation.
* May take too long to implement self-replication over a network.
    * Solution: Not part of MVP, server will search for bootstrap clients.

1. I would expect to see more progress toward implementation. At least the project skeleton should be up by now.
